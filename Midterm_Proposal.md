<b><h3> How does the number of health establishments and their quality of services offered is affected by the median household income of the zip code they are located in? (LA County)</b></h3>

Our project is aimed to showcase the accessibility to health services depending on an income-based distribution within Los Angeles County. By utilizing census and quantitative data we will be able to visualize how the distribution of health services is affected by the median household income of the population they are being offered to. Our project will also provide insight as to how the enrollment of facilities in the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) has historically changed with the creation of new healthcare services that target low income communities (The Affordable Care Act). Health promotion and disease prevention is vital to improve the quality of life of all individuals, especially in low-income areas that experience resource limitations and have less accessibility to hospitals and other care. Large numbers of preventable deaths are at stake, it is a human necessity to receive medical care in order to detect and treat diseases in a safe and timely manner. 

  ### What is the spatial scope?
The spatial scope for our project is the United States, more specifically, Los Angeles County in California. Los Angeles County has the largest population in all of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.9% of the population living in Los Angeles County are currently below the poverty level. It is important to understand how allocation of medical services is affected by the area where healthcare centers are located. The quantitative and census data used includes the location of all the medical clinics and the median household income of each zip code within Los Angeles County. The data we used for the median household income is directly from the U.S. Census Bureau and was collected in 2019, the most recent records published. The data we used for the certified Healthcare facility listing is from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and is updated weekly. Our aim was to create visualizations that use data that is as updated as possible to accurately reflect the current discrepancies in the healthcare sector in LA County.

### Data Sources
For our project, we will be reviewing data sources centered on health care facilities and population income in the region. Provided by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the "Licensed and Certified Healthcare Listings" dataset will allow us to view active facilities in the state of California. Using this we can analyze the number of healthcare facilities in different neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the services they offer. Similarly, we have data that focuses on a variety of healthcare programs within the county of Los Angeles, which is provided by the Los Angeles County office of Enterprise Geographical Information Systems. We will also view data provided by the Census Reporter which gives details on the median household income by zip code in Los Angeles County.

### Visualizations 

With these data sources, we created multiple visualizations of the data sets. Some of our visualizations include: a choropleth map of the median household income in LA County, Open Street Maps of high and low income communities and the number of healthcare facilities within those same zip codes, a choropleth map of the census data, multiple point maps of the location of different medical services and an interactive map of the Health Education and Counseling Services in the county. These visualizations allow us to explore how federal and state funding should prioritize certain communities that are most underrepresented. 

### Insights and Conclusion
Our exploration of the data showed that there exists a discrepancy in the medical services available for the population of Los Angeles County. Our service and income distribution maps show that in some cases, areas with higher median household income tend to have more access to healthcare providers while areas with lower income have less accessibility to health services. Our count of the healthcare services accessible within the county and the time charts of how enrollment in federally funded services increased after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which extended the medical benefits of its recipients. This could potentially be indicative of the necessity of healthcare resources that were lacking previous to the implementation of Obamacare.
